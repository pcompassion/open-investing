#+title: Decision

where if first order is fulfilled then perform second order,
and if first order is partially fulfilled, perform second order proportionally



if first order is not fulfilled and diverged (first order was limit order and price moved to the opposite direction so that it's harder to meet the limit order price),
change the first order's limit order price
